## Filing issues with Begin

If you have an issue that you have reason to believe impacts all Begin users, and not just your project, [please report it here](https://github.com/smallwins/begin-issues/issues/new?template=bug-report.md)!

If you are experiencing an issue that may be specific to your account or project, involves billing or sensitive information, or just aren't sure what the best venue to ask your question is, please [open a ticket in our private support system](https://help.begin.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).


## Feature requests & enhancements

We love your feature requests and product feedback, [please post them here](https://github.com/smallwins/begin-issues/issues/new?template=feature-request.md)!


## Issues with Begin documentation

Did you know that [this docs site](/) is a separate, fully open source Begin app, and has its own issue tracker?

If you see something wrong, please head on over to the [Begin docs repo](https://github.com/smallwins/docs.begin.com) to file docs-related [issues and requests](https://github.com/smallwins/docs.begin.com/issues/new/choose). (PRs are welcome, by the way!)
