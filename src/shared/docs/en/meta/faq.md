### When will Begin support [Azure, GCP, OpenWhisk, _____]?

Multi-cloud vendor support is absolutely on our roadmap! The will be prioritized primarily based on three factors:

- Customer feedback: we strive to build a company culture where our customers are the ones telling us what to do. So if multi-cloud serverless support is important, we'd love to [hear from you more about why that is, and how you'd like us to implement it](/en/support/issues/)!
- Viability of alternative platforms: while Google, Microsoft, IBM, and other cloud vendors are doing excellent work, we do not yet feel they have serverless offerings that are quite as competitive as what's available in AWS's stack. As always, we will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the landscape!
- Open source contributions: the open source core of Begin is available for your PRs. If you'd like to accelerate Begin's adoption of other cloud vendors, a great way to catalyze that is to [land some commits in Architect](https://github.com/arc-repos/)!


### When will Begin support [Python, Go, _____]?

Additional runtimes are also very much on our roadmap! We opted to try to do one thing really well first, and as soon as our JS platform is proven out, we will absolutely be including support for additional runtimes.

Of course, if you'd like to accelerate Begin down that path, a surefire way to catalyze that progress is to [land some commits in Architect](https://github.com/arc-repos/)!


### What is Begin's business model?

We're still dialing in the specifics, but Begin's business model will look a little something like this:

- **Free**: some limits, runs on our AWS, free! [currently in private beta]
- **Pro**: one user, multiple apps, runs on our AWS, paid [coming soon!]
- **Teams**: many users, many apps, runs on our AWS, paid [coming soon!]
- **Enterprise**: many users, many apps, runs on **your** AWS, paid [on the roadmap]

We're committed to the cause of democratizing building software. Insofar as cloud platforms make it feasible for us to do so, we'll always offer folks access to building an app for free.


### Should I use Begin or Architect?

Generally, it really depends on your needs. We built software on Architect for quite a while before building Begin (which is, of course, built on Architect, and on itself), and it was great. We built Begin to extend Architect
