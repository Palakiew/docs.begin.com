## Overview

Each of your Begin app's three hosted environments (`testing`, `staging`, and `production`) has its own set of independently configurable environment variables.

The name of each environment is available by default as `NODE_ENV`.

Configured variables are available to all processes within each environment at runtime.


## Adding variables

To add your environment variables, open `Environments` in the left nav in Begin.

Under the environment you want to add a variable to (i.e. `staging`), add your key and value, and click `Add`.

This variable is now available to all your Functions in `staging` â€“ no deploy necessary!

> Note: keys can only contain upper case alphanumeric characters and underscores (`[A-Z0-9_]`), and must start with a letter. Values are limited to 255 characters.


## Editing variables

To modify an existing environment variable, overwrite it with a new variable with the key you want to overwrite.

To delete a variable, simply click the red delete icon.
