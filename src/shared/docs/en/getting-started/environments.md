## Overview

Each of your Begin app's three hosted environments (`testing`, `staging`, and `production`) has its own set of independently configurable environment variables.

The name of each environment is available by default as `NODE_ENV`.

Configured variables are available to all processes within each environment at runtime.


## Adding variables

To add your environment variables, open `Environments` in the left nav in Begin.

Under the environment you want to add a variable to (i.e. `staging`), add your key and value, and click `Add`.

This variable is now available to all your Functions in `staging` â€“ no deploy necessary!

> Note: keys can only contain upper case alphanumeric characters and underscores (`[A-Z0-9_]`), and must start with a letter. Values are limited to 255 characters.


## Editing variables

To modify an existing environment variable, overwrite it with a new variable with the key you want to overwrite.

To delete a variable, simply click the red delete icon.

## Using Variables While Developing

When working in your development environment, you may need to provide different environment variables. Begin uses [Architect](https://arc.codes/) to run your functions, and the same applies for local development. You can see the environment variables documentation for Architect [here](https://arc.codes/reference/cli/env#the-arc-env-file).

To add an environment variable, first add a `.env` file to your project. This file should also be included in your `.gitignore` file. The `.env` file is automatically read by `arc sandbox` and populates `process.env`.

For your development environment, you should use the `@testing` environment. Your `.env` file may look like this:

```
# example .env
@testing 
SOME_VAR_1=some-value
SOME_VAR_2=some-other-value
```
