Hello, and welcome! We can't wait to share everything you need to know about Begin.

## What is Begin?

Begin is a **cloud function continuous deployment platform**.

More specifically: Begin orchestrates the provisioning and management of a wide range of next-generation AWS cloud infrastructure; and once connected to your version control system, Begin automatically takes care of CI and deployment, so you can focus on your product, not on infra, tooling, or scaling.

### Why build with Begin?

Begin enables you to take full advantage of AWS's next-generation cloud infrastructure without the hassle and setup. Think: serverless stack on easy mode.

Some key properties of apps built with Begin:

- **Instantly deployable, deploy instantly**: Begin CI is fast: get from commit to green builds in seconds, not minutes; deployment to AWS is near-instantaneous
- **Nearly infinitely scalable**: native AWS cloud compute means pre-provisioning infra and extensive capacity planning are things of the past
- **Highly debuggable**: per route isolation reduces the time to find problems and ship fixes
- **Staging isolation**: fully isolated staging environment is automatically set up right alongside production
- **Cost-effective**: pay for what you use, not for what you think you may need
