Hello, and welcome! We can't wait to share everything you need to know about Begin.


## What is Begin?

Begin is a **cloud function continuous deployment platform**.

More specifically: Begin orchestrates the provisioning and management of a wide range of next-generation AWS cloud infrastructure.

Once connected to your codebase, Begin automatically takes care of CI and deployment so you can focus on your product – not on infra, tooling, or scaling.


### Why build with Begin?

Begin enables you to take full advantage of AWS's next-gen cloud infra without the hassle and setup. Think: *serverless stack on easy mode*.

Some key properties of apps built with Begin:

- **Super fast CI, instantaneous deployment**: go from commit to green build to running code in seconds
- **Nearly infinitely scalable**: native AWS Lambda-based compute means never having to pre-provision infra or spend time on capacity planning
- **Highly debuggable**: per route isolation reduces the time required to find problems and ship fixes
- **Staging isolation**: baked-in fully isolated staging environment is automatically set up right alongside production
- **Cost-effective**: pay for what you use – not for what you think you may need


### What can you build with Begin?

Within a few certain limitations, just about anything you can build with Node and a database.

Here are just a few ideas:

- Fast, scalable static web sites
- Powerful database-backed web applications
- APIs
- Backends for mobile apps
- Slack apps
- Alexa Skills

Begin currently supports the following:

- Runtime: Node 8.10
- Package management: NPM 6.0.1
- Version control: GitHub

## Background & open source governance

Begin, uh, began as a cloud infrastructure framework built help manage the immense complexities associated with orchestrating software releases to hundreds of Lambdas, API Gateways, and other AWS serverless services.

That project became known as [Architect](https://arc.codes), which we (Small Wins) partnered with and donated to the [JS Foundation](https://js.foundation/) in 2017 under an open governance model and Apache 2 license.

Architect and Small Wins are committed to building open, inclusive open source communities. If you like Begin, we'd love for you to participate in Architect! (We kindly ask you agree to the [CLA](https://js.foundation/cla), and [JSF](https://js.foundation/community/code-of-conduct) and [Small Wins](https://github.com/smallwins/policy/blob/master/begin-community-code-of-conduct.md) Codes of Conduct.

Apps built with Begin are fully compatible with Architect; should you want to, we are also committed to making it easy to eject your Begin project and move it to your own cloud infrastructure.
