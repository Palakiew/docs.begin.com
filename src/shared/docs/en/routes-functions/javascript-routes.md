## Overview

Begin JavaScript routes respond with HTTP `Content-Type: text/javascript`, and support routes with [`GET`](#get-routes).

Each JavaScript route (example: `GET /appjs`) in your app is assigned a folder in your project under `src/js/` (i.e. `src/js/get-appjs/`).

Within your project, each route can contain and utilize an arbitrary quantity of modules, packages, and other files (so long as the total uncompressed size of that route's folder is â‰¤5MB).

JavaScript routes work well for delivering ES modules, or as an origin for your app's pre-compiled client-side JS. They're also surprisingly excellent at compiling and bundling JS in real time, which can be quite useful for iterating rapidly.

> Note: Begin routes are plain AWS Lambda functions, and can function without requiring `@architect/functions`. However, we do not suggest removing that require, as you will lose middleware and session support.

## `GET` routes

Let's look at the default code for new JavaScript `GET` routes:

```js
// src/js/get-*/index.js
let begin = require('@architect/functions')

function route(req, res) {
  let request = JSON.stringify(req, null, 2)
  console.log('hello backend', request)
  res({
    js: `console.log('hello frontend', ${request})`
  })
}

exports.handler = begin.js.get(route)
```


## `begin.js.get()`

Invoked by the route's `handler`, `begin.js.get()` accepts one or more functions that follow an [Express-style middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html) signature: `(req, res, next)`

## Parameters

### `req`

`req` returns a JavaScript object with the following keys:

- `method` - HTTP method (always returns `get`)
- `path` - path requested (i.e. `/appjs`)
- `headers` - object containing HTTP request headers
- `query` - object containing query string fields & values
- `body` - always returns empty object
- `params` - object containing path params (returned empty unless your route contains params)
- [`session`](/en/routes-functions/sessions/) - object containing session data
- `csrf` - signed cross-site request forgery token (generated with all requests, but primarily intended to be used with HTML `POST` routes)


### `res()`

`res()` is a function that must be invoked; it accepts a JavaScript object with the following keys:

- Either `js` or `location` (**required**)
  - `js` - a string containing JavaScript content
  - `location` - a URL, either absolute or relative; sets HTTP status to `302` without using the `status` key
- [`session`](/en/routes-functions/sessions/#how-sessions-work) (optional) - object containing session data
- `status` (optional) - alternately `code` or `statusCode`, sets HTTP error status code, supports the following values:
  - `400` - Bad Request
  - `403` - Forbidden
  - `404` - Not Found
  - `406` - Not Acceptable
  - `409` - Conflict
  - `415` - Unsupported Media Type
  - `500` - Internal Server Error

`res()` can also be invoked with an instance of `Error`. You can also optionally define the `Error` object's HTTP status code by adding to it a `status`, `code`, or `statusCode` property (with one of the seven status codes above).


### `next` (optional)

Callback argument to continue execution.
