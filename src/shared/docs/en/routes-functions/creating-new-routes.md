## Overview

Creating new routes is super easy!

Simply [open your app in Begin](https://begin.com), and in the left nav find the section of the type of Function you want to create a route for (i.e. `HTML Functions`). Then click its corresponding `Add new Function` button.

All Functions begin with `/`, and can include letters, numbers, and slashes, up to 25 characters.

It's also possible to build dynamic routes using Express-style parameters, like: `GET /shop/:item`
<!-- @todo learn more about routes with parameters in our project doc(s) -->

After clicking `Add Function`, the following things happen automatically:
- The new route is saved to your Begin app's configuration
- Infrastructure is provisioned to make the route publicly available
- A basic Function is committed to your project in the `src/html/` folder
- A build is kicked off, and, if green, is deployed to `staging` (but not `production`)

> âœ¨ Tip: It's possible to have multiple HTTP methods respond from the same URL path! For example: `GET /contact-us` and `POST /contact-us` is totally valid.


## More about routes in Begin

Want to learn a little more about how routes in Begin are born?

Well, as it turns, the AWS infrastructure needed to marshal your app's requests and responses is a separate and different from the cloud compute that runs your code.

This architecture is capable of enormous scale, and is one of the many things Begin manages for you behind the scenes.

Routes in Begin apps generally consist of the following parts:
- A publicly available URL route (represented by a path and HTTP method) in two separate, fully isolated AWS API Gateways (one for `staging`, one for `production`) that call to...
- Your Function code, which runs in two separate, fully isolated AWS Lambdas (one for `staging`, one for `production`), which support sessions out of the box via...
- Your app's session stores, which are persisted in two separate, fully isolated DynamoDB tables (one for `staging`, one for `production`)
