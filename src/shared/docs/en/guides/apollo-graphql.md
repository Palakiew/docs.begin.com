> ⏱ This tutorial is an introductory walkthrough of creating an Apollo GraphQL app on Begin. It should take fewer than 15 minutes.

## Introduction

**Hello there, Beginner!**

This tutorial uses the [Apollo GraphQL Begin starter example](https://github.com/begin-examples/node-apollo), extended by an example API endpoint. 

### What is GraphQL?
Created by Facebook in parallel with React, GraphQL is a query language that defines a set of constraints for APIs. It has a built-in server-side runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Basically, it is used to load data from a server to a client **-- it’s a way to get data from an API into your application.** The principles of GraphQL are extremely useful building blocks for web applications.

### What is Apollo?
Apollo is the industry-standard GraphQL implementation, providing the data graph layer that connects modern apps to the cloud.

The Apollo platform is an implementation of GraphQL that can transfer data between the cloud (server) to the UI of your app. In fact, Apollo builds its environment in such a way that we can use it to handle GraphQL on the client as well as the server side of the application.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have **git** and **Node.js** installed to your local computer to follow along with this tutorial. (Learn more about [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).)

You'll also need a GitHub account. (Learn more about [signing up with GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github).)

Although it would be helpful to have some experience with Vue, it's not required to follow along with this tutorial. (Related, the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) are a great reference.)

This tutorial also assumes some familiarity with such things as:
- Text editors
- Terminal / CLI
- Git and version control
- General software development using JavaScript

You do not need to be an expert in any of these things in order to follow along and make your first React app in Begin!
