> ‚è± This tutorial is an introductory walkthrough of creating a React app on Begin. It should take fewer than 15 minutes.

## Introduction

**Hello there, Beginner!**

This tutorial uses the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) starter app, extended by an example API endpoint. You'll have all the capabilities of Vue for building beautiful user interfaces, combined with the power, speed, and security of cloud functions and serverless data storage.


### Prerequisites

You will need to have **git** and **Node.js** installed to your local computer to follow along with this tutorial. (Learn more about [installing git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).)

You'll also need a GitHub account. (Learn more about [signing up with GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github).)

Although it would be helpful to have some experience with Vue, it's not required to follow along with this tutorial. (Related, the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) are a great reference.)

This tutorial also assumes some familiarity with such things as:
- Text editors
- Terminal / CLI
- Git and version control
- General software development using JavaScript

You do not need to be an expert in any of these things in order to follow along and make your first React app in Begin!
